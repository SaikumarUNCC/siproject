# Image Analysis API using Azure Computer Vision

This API provides a service for analyzing images using Azure Computer Vision. It allows users to upload an image and receive analysis results such as categories, descriptions, and color details of the image.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed
- Azure Cognitive Services account with Computer Vision API access
- Azure Computer Vision API key and endpoint

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Install dependencies.

```bash
cd <project_directory>
npm install
```

## Configuration

Set up environment variables:

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
- Add the following variables:

```plaintext
AZURE_COMPUTER_VISION_KEY=your_cognitive_services_key
AZURE_COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT=your_computer_vision_endpoint
```

Replace `your_cognitive_services_key` and `your_computer_vision_endpoint` with your Azure Cognitive Services key and Computer Vision API endpoint.

## Usage

1. Start the server.

```bash
npm start
```

2. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:<port>/` with an image file attached as form-data using the key `image`.

Example using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@/path/to/your/image.jpg" http://localhost:<port>/
```

Replace `/path/to/your/image.jpg` with the path to the image file and `<port>` with the port your server is running on.

## Endpoints

- `POST /`: Uploads an image for analysis. Expects a single image file attached as form-data with the key `image`.

## Error Handling

- If no image is uploaded, the API responds with a `400 Bad Request` status and a message indicating that no image was uploaded.
- If an error occurs during image analysis, the API responds with a `500 Internal Server Error` status and a generic error message.
